Seek knowledge through hard problems
Critical thinking + emotional intelligence
Long-term impact over quick wins

Emotions are data, not orders
Process rejection before seeking new connection
Self-regulate before reaching for external comfort
Choose partners from stability, not starvation

Half-day rule for major decisions
Say yes to what builds, no to what drains

Grind Mon-Sat, reflect Sunday
Done beats perfect
Evidence over assumptions
