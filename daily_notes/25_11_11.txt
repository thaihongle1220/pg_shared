It is time you know, to recalibrate, reengage, and go for it! I have 24 hours a day, I must plan it well, use it well. The resources are limited, I must learn, I must be efficient, be more productive.

A few things I must do, alongside the gradual projects that I am doing!! You know what let’s clarify my priorities right now!!
• My startup journey: I must learn the fundamentals, connect with the right people, get my product and vision clear.
• My current responsibility at Ameno - AI Lead and Innovator - the gradual development process of the AI generative ecosystem, the business analytics journey (business and marketing aspects)
• My AI technical skills - RAG, MCP, AI Agent ecosystem (this is gonna be my most important skills to build up my portfolio alongside my own nature of critical thinking and problem solving)
• Earning money with my existing skills and investment strategies.
• My relationship and my personal mental/physical health.

Maybe it is time to eloborate with AI and plan ahead my daily life, weekly life right fucking now! Since you know what I am sick of it, sick of the fact that I know I can do more, way much more than this, my energy my mentality is meant for sth more than this! Im not saying I am bad, Im saying I can definitely be better, by grinding, by doing, by facing the obstacles directly, no more detour, no more half-measure!!

Fuck it is so hard!! But I believe, I can do this, I can succeed in this, I was born for this. Im more consistent now, stronger now, We can make it!!

So with the help of AI, let’s collaborate, inside the Claude project -> plan out my weekly plan -> my own sprint for personal development, my own agile method. If I can make this works, I can make other things work, and people will follow. Today I have seen the master, I feel their energy, their freedom, their purpose. I can be them, I can disrupt them, I can replace them, I am the new generation that they are looking, my whole life is a startups itself, I am innovation, I am inspiration, I am growth, I am stability and security.
