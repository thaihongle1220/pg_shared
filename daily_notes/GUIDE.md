# Daily Notes - How to Use

## Purpose
Raw, unfiltered thoughts to track patterns, catch blind spots, and cut through overthinking.

## Format
- **Date**: `YY_MM_DD.txt` (e.g., 25_11_01.txt for Nov 1, 2025)
- **Language**: Whatever flows - Vietnamese, English, mixed
- **Style**: YOUR voice - raw, unfiltered, authentic
- **Frequency**: 4-5x/week realistic (not daily pressure)

## Structure

### Main Body
Write whatever's on your mind:
- Thoughts, feelings, observations
- Decisions you're wrestling with
- Patterns you're noticing
- Things bothering you
- Things going well

**No rules. Just write.**

### Reflection Section (Optional but Recommended)
After writing, add:

```
---
## THINGS TO IMPROVE (DD/MM/YY)

**Stop doing:**
- [Pattern you caught yourself doing]
- [Thing costing you energy/time/focus]
- [Behavior misaligned with your goals]

**Start doing:**
- [Action to take based on what you wrote]
- [New habit to build]
- [Thing you know you should do but avoid]

**Remember:**
- [Truth you need to hear]
- [Evidence that counters your doubts]
- [Principle from IDENTITY.md you're forgetting]
```

## Key Principles

1. **Write for yourself, not for show** - This is your private space for truth
2. **Catch patterns across time** - Claude will help you see themes you miss
3. **Observer mode alert** - If you spend more time writing than doing, you're stuck
4. **Trust your gut** - If you already know the answer, stop writing and act
5. **No pressure on frequency** - Write when useful, not because you "should"

## What Claude Does

- Checks fluency/flow while preserving your voice
- Spots patterns you're missing
- Calls out when you're overthinking vs. acting
- Adds "THINGS TO IMPROVE" section based on what you wrote
- References IDENTITY.md and GOALS.md to keep you aligned

## Red Flags

- Writing about doing instead of doing
- Seeking validation when gut already knows
- Observer mode: watching yourself write about watching yourself think
- Using writing to avoid hard decisions/actions

**If you catch these → Close file, take action**

## Integration with Life OS

- **IDENTITY.md** - Core principles guide analysis
- **GOALS.md** - Check if daily actions align with stated priorities
- **CAREER.md** - Track professional growth patterns
- **daily_notes/** - Pattern recognition over time
- **decisions/** - (Future) Track decisions + outcomes

**Remember:** This is a tool for clarity and action, not a diary. Write when it helps. Act when you know.
