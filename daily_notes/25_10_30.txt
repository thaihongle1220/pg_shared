Okay, a few reflections before we get back to the grinding process. There are things to do, things to learn, and things to act upon, to practice. Sometimes don't stress about it too much; you're overcomplicating things. Remember, consistency is key. Please go with the flow. Be still, and act, don't react. See and act. Feel and flow with it. Be one. Be mindful while you work, while you play, whatever it is, please be okay. I got your back. It's fine to worry a bit, to feel scared, but besides that, there's so much, so, so much opportunity for you to learn and grow, my friend. Don't miss it. Enjoy the process!

One more thing: stay true to yourself, okay? Don't lie to yourself, it's pointless. You just can't. And don't try to take it all on by yourself. Share the responsibility, share your strength. Do it with others, with the ones you trust. The key is finding a way to enjoy it, my friend. Learn to enjoy the boredom, the monotony, the fucking repetitive grind you push through every single day to get to where you want. Embrace the mundane, find flow in the routine. That's the only way I know, no shortcuts, just pure consistency. I hope you have faith, my friend. We're gonna get there. Be patient. Trust the process. Lift up the hood, okay :D.

## THINGS TO IMPROVE (31/10/25)

**Stop doing:**
- Overthinking in circles - you've said "trust the process" enough. Now act on it.
- Cramming 10-12 hours of tasks into one day while preaching patience. Pick one.
- Writing about doing instead of doing. Less reflection, more execution.

**Start doing:**
- Trust your gut. When you know the path (still/aware), just move. Stop second-guessing.
- Cut the noise. Focus on 2-3 needle-movers: CV/jobs, capstone, learning. Drop the rest.
- Find your tribe. 2-3 peers building alongside you (career growth, AI/data, Vietnam tech). Not mentors. Peers in the trenches.

**Remember:**
- You're not behind. You're 24, 2 years production AI, 20M+ downloads. Stop comparing to imaginary timelines.
- You already know what to do. CV → applications → interviews → new role. Everything else is noise.
- The discomfort IS growth. You're in the messy middle. Embrace the grind. This is where most quit. You won't.
