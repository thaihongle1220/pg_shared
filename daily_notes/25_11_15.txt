Funny I sitting here brainstorming with AIs. So previously last week, I plan my whole week on Tuesday, and till to day is already 3 and a half days (wed, thu, fri, sat)

Well for the company works, I did everything (exclude the NSFW things, since we have to prioritize other things first -> so I did do audio and the quality is good for 42 templates lora, and I did trained new 13 LoRA template/effect, and some other minor works but still needed) -- and I have this ideas of how to improve the products -> im gonna do it tmr (sunday)

And I did finalize the CVs and apply strategies!! However I haven’t apply to any company yet! 

Besides that I did have a football (soccer match with my company) and I did washes the clothes (white clothes) by hand, I mean this seems like nothing but, I havant attend any soccer match for a months since previously I have sprayed my angles, so I need to rest for 1 month. In that match, I haven’t fully cover yet, but I can still complete the match and I can sustain without any injuries, my angle still slightly hurt but nothing serious, it is fine. And in the match I feel like my feeling for the ball is better, I dont know why, but I think and believe I am improving, I hope so. That’s Thursday and I came home at around 9:30 -> then I washed my clothe and then I eat and rest. 

However 1 thing that I can’t anticipate is my feeling, I get to know this girl , it is 1 and a half months already, but it affects my emotion, the reason is that, the girl is seems so vulnerable, she has a heart breaking history in her last relationship, her boy friend betrayed her love and cheated on her, and now she getting to know me, but still refuse to meet me, I didn’t even hear the girl voice. But now I know she is not try to rob me or blackmail me or sth, now I know she is processing her emotion, and me as well, I have to learn to be patient, and I also have my own emotion and history as well, I want to connect to this girl, I kinda like her, and want to help, so I guess I need to be patient. The reason I mention this is that the I stayed silence for 1 day, not seen her message and get her calls. Because I feel like this relationship is hurting me, the desire to connect, the desire to love and to be loved, and the longing for intimacy, it hurting me, and I failed to process it, I stayed silence for a day. And then I text here telling her my feelings, what I got back is her silence, Im fine now no big deal since I kinda understand the problem, and kinda understand the person Im dealing with. And I believe this is where I learnt, she will help me grow, I am willing to bet on her, that’s I need to learn to be patient and consistent. Yeah that’s just what it is right now, Today around afternoon I did text her (after 16 hours since last message) (and she still stay silent) saying that I understand her, showing her my thoughts about how I think why she did what she did, and that’s it, I end with the message that I hope she well, and fine, and if she want she can talk to me. That’s all, I think this is gonna be my last message, if she doesn’t message me back, I think this is gonna be the end. It is what it is I think, sometimes people I just not ready, despite the fact that she did accept my gifts, sometimes I bought food for her, and she did say that she liked me, but in fact she is not ready, I should come to accept that as soon as possible, so that I can spend the energy and pour it towards my works.

This seems embarrassing but my old self emerged, the things I dont want to remember, the thing that I did to cope with pain and anxiety that I am not proud of, but I guess I need to stay real, it is me, I can not run away from it any longer. So on Thursday at midnight, I can’t sleep so I watch tvs after late supper, and then I read this manga on the web (on my phone) the manga is a bit fantasy along with some erotic scene, the story is about a woman in her 35 I think, in her divorced since her 13 years husband cheated on her, and she met a young guys, mysterious guys, tall, handsome, rich, who is actually the heir of some very very successful, rich and powerful family, the guys is weird, he is capable and he patiently earn her trust. The thing is when reading that manga, it triggers all of my own feelings, the one I try to hide in my past 2 relationships. First one is since highshool, last a bout 6-7 years, the love is pure and instinctive, but it ends in 2021-2022, and in Nov 2024 I start my second relationship, it was weird, but I did grow a lot, I help her and she help me, but at some points she is too agreeable, I dont know she seems so weak and helpless it stressed me out, so I quit along with the pressure from every family and friend I know they said she is not right for me, I dont want to get into details but it is what it is, the rela last 1 years almost, and then Im looking for new one to talk, I met the current one in a dating app (tinder) similar to the second one. Well that’s my story. The thing I mention this is like, I missing the old feeling, the old sensations of love, and I missed the sex, so I masturbated 2 times try to find that rushes again, trying to numb the pain, and then I smoke, quite a lots, not the whole pack but way more than I used to (1-2 a days). And that’s it Thursday late night (Friday dawn) -> I stay up till 4am. And the rest of the day is pretty dull, I reflect on my relationship, do absolutely nothing, I rest since the day before I did worked a lot both mentally and physically. And I did stay up late as well, till 5am (saturday) -> I even skip the Saturday morning classes, but after a while I said enough enough, I clean my shit up and go to the company and trying to deal with it. So what I did last night is playing games until the battery ran out, and then I watch some porn and I masturbated twice, trying to find the sexual pleasure again, I even tempted to connect to my last girlfriend just for sex, this is weird (even to me), (I didn’t do it, but the urge is real), since this is not my principles at all. But for some reason, my emotions emerged and I can not control it. For quite sometimes, I guess before I breakup with my first girlfriend, I let my emotions run wild like this. But I am more resistant now, that’s why I want you to know, since I want to improve, I respect and accept my emotion, my self, but I will not let it define me our decide my behaviors, I am way pass that. 

And the reason I mention this is because for me, to do what I aim to do, my emotions need to be stable, not always the same but I must learn to see and accept it, no more running or trying to escape, I need to find a way to endure and to resist. This is what it is. Please tell me your most honest opinion, based on what you knew about me, I know this project cannot express everything about me, but I guess you have enough!!

## THINGS TO IMPROVE (15/11/25) - Claude's Assessment

**Stop doing:**
- Girl situation is destroying you - 1.5 months, never met, never heard her voice, goes silent when you open up. She's not ready. YOU can't afford this drain. End it.
- Numbing behaviors (4x masturbation, heavy smoking, gaming till battery dies, porn spirals) - You're medicating pain, not processing it
- 4-5am sleep schedule - This kills everything: energy, discipline, clarity, health
- Avoiding job applications (0 sent, target was 10-15) - The real fear you're running from. Girl drama is distraction from job rejection fear.
- Isolating when struggling - You know this is your defect, but you didn't reach out to anyone

**Start doing:**
- END THE GIRL SITUATION TOMORROW - Final message: "I care about you, but I need to focus on myself. Hope you heal. If timing is better in future, reach out." Then block app for 3 months. Not to hurt her. To save yourself.
- 5 job applications tomorrow (Sunday) - Break the zero. Prove you can do it.
- Sleep by 11pm EVERY NIGHT - Non-negotiable for Week 47. Reset the pattern.
- Reach out when emotions spiral - Text friend, family, anyone. Don't isolate and numb.
- Apply the principle you wrote: "I will not let emotions define me or decide my behaviors" - Prove it's not just words.

**Remember:**
- Week 46 delivery: You shipped 42 audio templates, 13 LORA models, quality work. When focused, you execute.
- You have 4 months to go from $600 → $2K-6K/month. You manage 4 engineers, serve 20M+ users. You're worth it.
- You can't pour from empty cup. Can't help her when drowning. Can't build relationship without stability.
- Two broken people trying to fix each other never works. Choose yourself first.
- Football match showed you CAN resist urges (didn't contact ex). You stopped the spiral Saturday. Evidence you CAN control when you choose to.

**THE TEST:** Tomorrow - end girl situation, send 5 applications, sleep by 11pm. That proves if you meant what you wrote or if it's just words.

**TRUTH:** This girl → emotional chaos → poor sleep → numbing → no job apps → stuck at $600 → more stress → more need for connection → cycle repeats. BREAK THE CYCLE.
